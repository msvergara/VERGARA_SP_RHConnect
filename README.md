Authors: Marian Stephanie C. Vergara and Asst. Prof. Rizza DC. Mercado

With the emergence of digital technology, creating and storing health records is essential to enhance patient care and efficiency. This study has developed a web-based electronic medical records system for the rural health center of Laur, Nueva Ecija. The system digitizes the record management process and automates administrative tasks such as the generation of medical certificates and referral letters in order to help the rural health center improve and become a better provider of high-quality, patient-centered care that enhances the quality of life for all members of the community. Usability testing conducted with healthcare professionals in the health center yielded a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 84, indicating an above-average and excellent user experience for the developed system.
